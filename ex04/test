In the heart of Florence, under Tuscan skies,
A place of knowledge, where curiosity lies.
It's not your ordinary school, it's something more,
Welcome to 42, where learning's an open door.

No teachers, no lectures, just problems to solve,
In the labyrinth of coding, where mysteries evolve.
From C to Python, and languages untold,
At 42 Florence, we're crafting stories of bold.

In the echo of keyboards, where friendships are made,
Collaboration and challenges, our skills displayed.
With dedication and passion, we embrace the quest,
At 42 Florence, we give our very best.

From sunrise to sunset, in this tech-filled land,
We code with purpose, with dreams in our hand.
In the heart of Florence, where the Arno flows,
42 is where every coder truly glows.

So here's to 42, where knowledge is the key,
In the city of art, where minds roam free.
Florence, our canvas, and code our rhyme,
At 42 Florence, we'll stand the test of time.
